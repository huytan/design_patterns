Here we solve the problem of exercise 2 because there is an "immutable" rectangle interface that will be implemented
both by rectangle and square. However the immutable rectangle does not have any setter.
Then we can check for the equality if the parameters belongs to an instance of immutableRectangle that is
implemented by rectangle and square that are by themselves different classes, with different "set" methods.

In this way we can, for example, put different "immutablerectangle" to collections.
