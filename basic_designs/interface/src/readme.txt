Let us build an application to calculate and display the salaries of different employees of an company
with the categorization of designations as listed

-----------------------------|--------------------
         Designations        |  Category                  
-----------------------------|--------------------
 Programmer,Designer,..      |  Category-A                  
-----------------------------|--------------------
 Sales Rep, Sales Manager,.. |  Category-B                  
-----------------------------|--------------------
 ......                      |  .......                  
-----------------------------|--------------------
 C-level Executives          |  Category-n          
 -------------------------------------------------      
 
 Let us assume that the application needs to consider only those employees whose designations are part of Category-A.
 
 and assume the application also needs to calculate the salary of employees who are part of Category-B.
